			My name is Alayna, and I'm an AuDHD transfem dragonkin! My pronouns are sy/syr (but she/her is ok too if you
			have trouble with neopronouns!), which are dragon pronouns from a dragon conlang I'm making called Sykhate!
			Can you tell I like dragons? x3
			<br><br>
			There's not very much here at the moment unfortunately... I'm a bit lazy with working on this place, but
			I'll get to it eventually.<br>
			I actually meant to update much sooner, but, I had the unfortunate timing of setting this up right before I
			played
			Undertale Yellow for the first time, and well... Let's just say my brain has been a little broken ever
			since...<br>
			But, that's for a blog post, once I get enough framework to get a blog going. In the meantime, play
			Undertale Yellow, it's so so so good :3
